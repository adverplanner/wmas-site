    <title>Modestep Takeover Social Virus - We Make Awesome Sh</title>
    <meta content='Modestep launched their new album, Evolution Theory, on Monday 11th February. To promote their new album they wanted to do some kind of Facebook takeover. They asked us to help spread a “virus”.In order to “infect” the public, we needed the public to let us. We came up with a simple method. Most people are more than happy to provide access to their accounts in return for something they deem valuable. So, we let people download a free song from Modestep’s new album, as long as they signed in via either their Twitter or Facebook account. What they didn’t realise was that this meant we now had all the access we needed to spread the “virus”.On launch day, unbeknownst to the awaiting “victims” our app auto-posted a message on all the “compromised” accounts along with a link to a site which showed a blue screen of death, informing the victim that they were now “infected with the Modestep virus”.Results:As we expected, people were more than happy to hand over their privileges. Not many people were unhappy with the “violation”, some were. Less than expected.The campaign creative and messaging was bang on for Modestep’s audience."I bought the album because of this!" - Facebook fan"This is the best thing I have seen all year" - Twitter userTwitter spam detection was non-existent, however Facebook blocked us after 1000 posts. Variations on the auto-post text and multiple links could have prevented this, although getting blocked from Facebook was actually seen as a bonus by Modestep themselves. Apparently they like being naughty. Who’d have thought it.1000’s of simultaneous tweets and posts on Facebook put Modestep in front of fans and social media users around the world.An interesting learning about social sign in behaviour - people should be more careful about their write permissions, you have no idea who you are giving access to.' name='description'>
