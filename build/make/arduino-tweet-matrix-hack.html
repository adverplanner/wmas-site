    <title>Arduino Tweet &amp; Matrix Hack  - We Make Awesome Sh</title>
    <meta content='At Barcamp Bournemouth, we made an arduino hack that displayed tweets on an 8 by 8 LED matrix. It displayed tweets containing a specific hashtag is a custom typeface that we created, "Lawrence Sans". Once this was completed we then connected it up to a real time website. Where people could turn each LED on and off.This made that people could draw on our LED board from their website all around the world. This got people from all over the place drawing, you guessed it, penises.We won the hack competition :)The typeface we created "Lawrence Sans" is available on github and some kind gentleman, Brandon Hawkes, created an actual downloadable font (ttf) of it. We definitely need to use this font on this site.' name='description'>
