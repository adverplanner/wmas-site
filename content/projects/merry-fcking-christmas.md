For Christmas 2012, we decided that we should celebrate the holiday period with our friends. We created a simple site for our clients and friends to send in their favourite cracker jokes by sms. So many agencies do similar digital cards, and they are all a bit meh. We decided to go over the top meh, and make the worst experience we could think of.
