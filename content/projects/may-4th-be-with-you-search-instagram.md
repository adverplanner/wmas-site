The 4th of May will always be a date that reminds us just how far cinema has come since 1977. Oh, and just how epic Star Wars was, of course. To celebrate this monumental day we uploaded the entire opening crawl to Instagram as separate image uploads and then put it in front of anyone visiting Search Instagram that day, along with a dubstep version of The Imperial March, obviously.
