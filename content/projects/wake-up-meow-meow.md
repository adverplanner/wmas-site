*#WakeUpMeowMeow* is an interactive video installation to promote Meow Meow's Little Match Girl show at the Royal Festival Hall.

The installation asked the public to text in their name to wake up Meow Meow. Meow Meow then gave the person a personalised festive message. This was projected onto the side of the Southbank Centre in London.
