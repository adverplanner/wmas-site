To promote Meow Meow’s Little Match Girl, they wanted to have some interactivity on the side of their building at the heart of London’s Southbank for a festive installation. James Cowdery, The Southbank Centre’s Head of Engagement, approached us with the idea of people sending in an SMS to modify a video that presents them with a personalised festive wish.

We built a simple web application that could be projected onto the side of the building. Using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for the SMS messaging, the passer by could send their name via text message. The videos were automatically spliced together in the correct arrangement using JavaScript and Meow Meow would then wake up and present a personalised festive wish, before going back to sleep again. The passer by then receives an SMS with a thank you message and a link to buy tickets.

## Results:
The projection captured the attention of thousands of passers by along Southbank and had hundreds of SMS interactions from users.
We successfully auto-filtered most* of the swear words we predicted would come in.
*Some unusual swear words came in… they were quickly added to moderation… after a bit of Google translate and giggles.
We had a giant video projected onto one of the most famous buildings along London’s Southbank. Awesome.
