Sony Music Entertainment asked us to help them develop an exercise app for NOW That’s What I call Music, specifically aimed at the more casual running audience. The app, NOW That’s What I Call Running, instantly creates a playlist for your running, track your running stats such as distance, calories burned, time and speed and even creates a running playlist that’s primed just right for the duration, energy and running speed you want. You can also check out what’s on the latest NOW albums and even buy them straight from the iTunes store, plus you can share your runs to Facebook or Twitter.

For a demo of how it works, check out this [lovely video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zedmWZMk3rA) or [download it yourself](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/now-running/id650086156?mt=8)
