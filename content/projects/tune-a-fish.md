What happens when Syd and Adz go to Digital Sizzle with the aim of creating something awesome out of “data”. What happens? Fish get hacked. Obviously.

With two fish swimming around in a tank, one called Biggie and one called Tupac (they are musical fish after all), a webcam and some clever code turned the movements of these ichthyoidic creatures into the most liquid music you’ve ever heard.

Quote of the project: “Fish are pretty random. So that’s kinda cool”  (Adz, 2012)

You can check out a demo of Biggie and Tupac (the fish, not the rappers) in action here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKb2eP1GKvM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKb2eP1GKvM) or, head down to Mozilla’s London HQ reception to see them for real!
