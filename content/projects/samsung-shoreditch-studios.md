We worked with Chiel and Samsung GALAXY to create Shoreditch Studio. From 14th October until 8th December, Shoreditch Studio @ Boxpark[This link](http://www.boxpark.co.uk)  will play host to some of London’s most cutting edge music labels. Each week a different label will be showcasing artists with live DJ sets and album playbacks. Plus, every Friday from 4pm, Mixmag will be streaming a box-rattling two hour live set from the Studio as part of their legendary DJ Lab sessions. 

Week 1 (live October 14th ' October 23rd) - Greco Roman[This link](http://greco-roman.net) 
Week 2/3 (live October 24th ' November 6th) - Defected[This link](http://defected.com) 
Week 4/5 (live November 7th ' November 20th) - Hospital Records[This link](https://www.hospitalrecords.com) 
Week 6/7 (live November 21st ' December 8th) - Anjunabeats[This link](http://www.anjunabeats.com) 

The Studio itself is modelled on the concept of a record store for the digital age, with real vinyl and album artwork up on the walls that visitors can pull onto their phones. Each vinyl has NFC tags which, when scanned, drops that exact vinyl onto the users phone. Pull over the arm, the needle touches the vinyl and you’ve got a HTML5 powered record spinning on your screen at 45 RPM. All with the necessary options to share and buy the tracks.

So if you fancy checking out this modern day homage to the classic vinyl record store then make sure you head down to Boxpark before 8th December. And if you’re unlucky enough to not have NFC on your phone, there’s plenty of awesome Samsung Galaxy devices to use when you get there.
