To launch kylie's new song we were heavily involved in a tweet to unlock campaign. Fans had to tweet **25000** times with *#KylieTimeBomb* to unlock the video for her new single Timebomb.

We managed to get the **number 1** worldwide trending topic on twitter after just **6 minutes**.

Perhaps this is why the client said "I love working with you" *swoon*
