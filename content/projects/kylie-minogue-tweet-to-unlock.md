We were asked to develop a social mechanic that could be used throughout the year to celebrate 25 years in the music industry for Kylie Minogue and help create buzz around each months new song release. One of the tracks to be released was called TimeBomb.

We created a twitter powered application that would only unlock each music video once fans had tweeted 25,000 times with #KylieTimeBomb. Once the tweet target had been reached, the video was revealed and the song made available on [iTunes](http://bit.ly/KSIeou) and [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/artist/4RVnAU35WRWra6OZ3CbbMA). This system could then be re-used each month by Kylie and her team.

## Results:
- We managed to get the number 1 worldwide trending topic on twitter in **6 minutes**.
- The song was unlocked in less than an hour and reached over 10 tweets per second.
- Kylie’s team continued to use the social mechanic for the rest of her 25th year in music
- Perhaps this is why the client said "I love working with you” **swoon**
- Saying that, we didn’t get to meet the pint sized princess  :(
