Batman Begins was awesome. The Dark Knight took that level of awesome to a whole new level of awesome. So how do you stop all those cretins on twitter who’ve seen the epic finale of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy before you from spoiling the ending for the rest of us?

Simple – install the Bat Blocker and you’ll see nothing – guaranteed – nothing to do with Batman until you’ve seen that the whole film trilogy was actually a bad dream yourself*.

If only Netflix had asked us to find and replace “Batman” with “Breaking Bad” for their Spoiler Foiler plug in and we could probably have saved them quite a bit of cash.

*NB. The Dark Knight Rises doesn’t actually end with Bruce Wayne waking up from a dream. It ends in Ben Affleck ruining the entire trilogy.
