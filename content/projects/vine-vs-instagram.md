When Instagram released it’s video update there was a lot of conversations taking place from online media, blogs and other industry news about whether Instagram Video would kill video and, if not, which platform was “best”. Rather than write a thought piece on the subject, we decided to make something to compare the two services instead. With a giant floating hand.

Vine vs Instagram simply pits the two platforms against each to see which platform has the best content. In the green corner, Vine, the original micro video startup owned by Twitter. In the blue corner, Instagram and the #selfie army.

Our Vine Vs Instagram experiment randomly picks a video from each service, where you can use our patented giant hand technology to pick your favourite video. Each click acts as a vote for that platform.

## Results:
- Over 27,000 visits and nearly 100,000 votes
- Coverage from lots of influential publications such as Luerzers Archive.
- FWA Site of the Day
