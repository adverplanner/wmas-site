Everyone knows the online world is a very special place. We started to see a trend of people uploading videos to the backing track of Baauer's Harlem Shake.</p><p>To capitalise on this potential craze, we created Harlem Shake Roulette, a simple site that showed a continuous stream of various user generated harlem shake videos.

We also got people to submit their own videos. Hundreds of people from all over the world submitted their own videos. From the likes of Ministry of Sound, McDonalds, Capcom, Yo Sushi, Facebook, Vimeo, Deezer, Spotify.
