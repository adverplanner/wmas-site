The Harlem Shake is an internet meme in the form of a video in which a group of people perform a ridiculous dance accompanied by a short excerpt from Baauer’s song ["Harlem Shake"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Shake_(song)). You probably know that already.

Harlem Shake Roulette was a project we created to capitalise on this video craze within a few hours of the meme developing; a simple site that showed a continuous stream of various user generated Harlem Shake videos.

## Results:
- Over 125,000 unique visitors wasting a combined total of 1,888 days of non-stop Harlem Shake action.
- Over 2.2 million impressions on twitter and nearly 2,500 shares on Facebook.
- Harlem Shake Roulette was visited by users from over 9,181 different cities around the world.
