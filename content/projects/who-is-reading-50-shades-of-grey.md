Probably one of the weirdest WMAS projects, but hey, that’s what happens when Tom gets sick and tired* of girls at work passing round the smutty book in a brown paper bag like it’s some sort of softcore porn VHS from 1998.

Who is reading 50 Shades of Grey simply pulled in any status from anyone who had publicly shared that they were reading E.L James’ naughty novel on Facebook on twitter. Users could then tweet back to those readers, with an auto-completed text field introducing them as Christian.

Many people thought it was hilarious (mostly blokes). Some people found it weird. But we’d like to think, at least one person out there met their Christian Grey/Anastasia Steele… although we take no responsibility for what may have happened afterwards.

*To clarify, Tom ended up being given a copy of the book as his leaving present (not anything to with the creation of this site, obviously). He still hasn’t read it.
