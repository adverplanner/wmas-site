Native LDN approached us to give them a helping hand with their campaign for Global Poverty Project. GPP has a campaign to eradicate polio, <a href='http://www.theendofpolio.com/home/'>The End Of Polio.

The client wanted a system that users could create their own superhero avatar to show their support for the campaign. We created an HTML5 Canvas tool to allow users to select various attributes of their Global Hero. As well as a simple way for people to export and share their generated heroes.

We were honoured to have the campaign featured as <a href='http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/bulletin/third_sector_fundraising_bulletin/article/1171891/the-global-poverty-project/' target='_blank'>Third Sector's Digital Campaign of the Week</a>

The campaign also had the backing of such people as Bill Gates, Stephen Fry and various others. We were tasked with creating custom heroes for each of the ambassadors. From our understanding, everyone involved liked their avatars.
