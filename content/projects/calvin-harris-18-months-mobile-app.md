**We created a mobile app for Columbia Records as part of the promo for Calvin Harris new album: 18 Months.**

The problem: Many of the album tracks had been already been released as singles, but due to licensing issues there was no way to 'upgrade' to the full album on iTunes. Meh :(

Our suggestion? Let's give it away... sort of.

So grab the app and you can listen to the whole album for free, so long as you're prepared to dance for it!
