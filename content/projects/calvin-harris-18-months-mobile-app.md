We were asked to promote the upcoming Calvin Harris album, 18 months, when over half the album had already been released as singles which many of his fans may have already bought. So we decided to give it away for free, but with a twist. You had to be dancing to listen to the music.

Using our Calvin powered “dance-o-meter”, as long as you were moving the phone, the songs would keep playing. You could listen to any track from the new album for free and unlock extra content such as exclusive remixes if you went on to buy. And throughout, a clear call to action to buy the album from the app persuaded users to do just that.

## Results:
- Number 6 UK app stores
- Before geo-restriction due to its popularity, number 3 in the Paraguay app store.
- Featured in Apple’s New and Noteworthy section
- 26% click through rate to buy the album
- Recommended by The Guardian as an app of the month
- Reviewed and played with live on BBC Radio 4
- Coined “a work of art from a digital rights management perspective” in music industry press
- Great feedback, reviews and ratings from users, with some using it as their new exercise app for running and short jogs
- FWA Mobile Site of the day, Google Creative Sandbox, Cannes Mobile Lions Shortlist, BIMA Finalist, Lovies Awards.
- Album itself went to number one in the UK album and dance charts

We created a legal, convenient and free way of distributing the album in one form to reduce piracy, whilst simultaneously offering a means to pay for full through the app. All whilst making the music do what it’s supposed to - make you get up and dance.
