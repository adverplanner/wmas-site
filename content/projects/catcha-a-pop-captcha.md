Most people know CAPTCHA is an acronym for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". However, a lot of people don’t realise it also stands for “Can Anything Please Tear my Curly Hair Apart as much as captchas”. Yes, they’re shit. When they’re not completely unreadable, they’re asking you to type in “agjlktldfvx”, which isn’t easy when it’s spelt “agljkt1bfvx”.

So, to solve this first world problem, Syd invented the Catcha. Yes, simply by removing the “P” (which stands for phucking useless) anyone can now replace these horrible computer identifiers into human friendly, and fun, cat powered verification tools.
