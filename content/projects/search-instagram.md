Search Instagram is the best place to search for Instagram images, and videos, online. Search Instagram is, arguably, the reason WMAS even exists. It’s by far our most popular project in terms of web views, global reach and longevity, so it’s funny to think all this is because of cats. Yep, that’s right. Cats.

Just a couple of hours after Instagram released their API, Tom and Syd created a ridiculous website called Instac.at that simply pulled in a live feed of cat images being uploaded to Instagram. Fuelled by the site going viral and noticing a lot of repeat visits and searches for brand related hashtags, we wanted to turn the idea into something more useful. Search Instagram.com was born.

## Results:
- Over 3.1 million visits and 2.4 unique visitors in 2 years
- Nearly 7 million page views with 25% of all web traffic being return visitors.
- With an average visit duration of 81 seconds, over 70,696 hours have been spent looking at the site. That’s 8 years. And that’s a lot of selfies, cats and food photos.
- Users from 214 different countries around the world have visited Search Instagram from over 4173 different cities.
- Responsible for pretty much everything that’s happened at WMAS since.
