Polydor approached us to help with the launch of the **Rolling Stones** Greatest Hits album 'Grrr'. For the launch of the album they were holding a pop up shop in the centre of Carnaby Street. Inside the pop up shop you could buy the album and countless other products such as posters, hoodies, t-shirts and other merch.

Polydor wanted to allow fans to listen to the album while they were shopping, not only in the pop up shop, but also near by it. If a fan visited the main Rolling Stones site, and they were accessing it from a mobile device, and within 1 mile of the store, they were redirected to a custom made mobile web site allowing them to pick and choose which song they wanted to listen to on the album.

We also created an image feed for use on both the main Rolling Stones website and also the Carnaby Street website, as they had a competition to get fans to submit photos using the various social networks. For the image feed we used the [Awesome Wall](http://awesomewall.wemakeawesomesh.it)</a>
