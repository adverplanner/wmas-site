It displayed tweets containing a specific hashtag is a custom typeface that we created, \"Lawrence Sans\". Once this was completed we then connected it up to a real time website. Where people could turn each LED on and off.</p><p>This made that people could draw on our LED board from their website all around the world. This got people from all over the place drawing, you guessed it, penises.</p><p>We won the hack competition :)</p><p>The typeface we created \"Lawrence Sans\" is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/skattyadz/Lawrence-Sans\">github</a> and some kind gentleman, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/brandonhawkes\">Brandon Hawkes</a>, created an actual <a href=\"http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/lawrence_sans\">downloadable font (ttf)</a> of it. We definitely need to use this font on this site.</p>",
