## Cardiff &bull; Halo &bull; Cats

Yep, it's not often that you see those three words next to each other. Even rarer when it's on an agency website. But then we're not about the ordinary. In fact, we're not really an agency. We're a collective. We're about the awesome. And Cardiff, Halo and Cats are all, we hope you'll agree, pretty bloody awesome.

We Make Awesome Sh was founded by Tom Gibby and Syd Lawrence. Tom and Syd met at Cardiff university through a shared love of all things gaming, geek and tech. We joked about one day starting our own company, little did we know that one final unexpected element would spark this opportunity – cats.

In early 2011, a few hours after the Instagram API was released, we built Instac.at, a comical site that quite literally displayed a live feed of cat images being uploaded to Instagram. After just 24 hours over 30,000 people had visited the site and a couple of weeks later that number had rocketed, fuelled by coverage from publications such as The Next Web and Mashable. The success of Instac.at lead to us creating Search Instagram – the best place to search for Instagram images online.

A few months later and we'd helped a number of brands integrate Instagram into their marketing and social media strategies, as well as increasing our offering to pretty much any piece of digital technology or social media application you can think of. More brands starting approaching us. Our roster of clients got bigger and bigger. We realised we’d accidentally created a monster and We Make Awesome Sh was born.

Just before the summer of 2012, Adam Howard joined us. He's a shit hot developer who loves to ski in a Pikachu costume. He makes awesome shit.

A couple of months later, Paul King joined us. This man tinkers like you wouldn't believe. It's an absolute pleasure to have him on the team. He also makes awesome shit.

Then, in March 2013, Rob Hampson jumped aboard. Rob is a shit hot designer. He makes our shit look awesome.

We work wherever we want to work. Our bases are our homes. However Syd has been known to work from yachts in Cannes, Tom primarily works at Poke, Adam likes to check out the sights while he works, like Trafalgar Square, quite literally, Rob often nips over to Italy for a bit of impromptu sun filled hot-desking, and Paul is famous for working whenever and wherever he god damn likes.
